# Dynamic-Welcome-Page
Webpage built entirely in JS - my early days of JS programming.

This was one of the first JS programs I wrote to allow me to understand it's command and interactions with HTML and CSS.

It simply checks the time of day and shows you appropriate greetings and images related to that time of day.
It also asks for a name which it displays with the greetings.

I don't write much JS inside HTML pages these days - this was before I knew of external files etc.
